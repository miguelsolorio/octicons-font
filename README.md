# octicons-font

### Intro
This tool was created to convert [GitHub Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons/tree/master/lib/octicons_node) into  an icon font using the [icon-font-generator](https://github.com/Workshape/icon-font-generator). This also adds a few custom icons from previous versions under `src > icons`. The mappings of the unicode characters are store under `src/template/mapping.json` as well as the default styles under `src/template/styles.hbs`.

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Use

```
npm run build
```

Output will be exported to `dist` folder.
